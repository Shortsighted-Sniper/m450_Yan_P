# Testing Strategy and Planning
A testing Strategy describes the way you test you application. For this you must create a test concept in which you define the most important elements for testing. Here are some simple factors of a testing strategy:
- Test-objects with a small description of how the Software looks
- List of elements of the SW that need testing
- Choosing a testing method
- Which testing infrastructure will be used
